# RPG Command
This is a command line tool for doing stuff for the Pathfinder RPG. Right now all it can do is create new characters and really it can't even do that yet. Right now it will create a json object "character sheet" up to choosing your skills. In the future I hope to make this tool do a lot more but for that I really need more time.

# Usage
The following will run the character generation script. It isn't finish but right now it is the only functionality.

```
node rpgcommand c
```

# TODO
Pretty much everything needs to be done at this point. Next up is properly calculating skill ranks based on the chosen allocation and class skills. Then I'll work on adding feats.
